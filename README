#Faculty of Computing and Information Technology Courses Registration System

## The Purpose of the Chosen Expert System

Our program works as an FCIT computer science students’ registration tool that helps 3rd, 4th, and 5th year students adding 
their courses based on their year, pre-course requirements, plus the maximum hours they can add. 
With our system, there is no need to spend time figuring out what pre-requirements should be studied, or to be concerned
if they reached the maximum number of hours or not, and that is going to happen by using AI knowledge to build a system that makes 
it easier for these students to add their courses by asking them multiple questions and then selecting an appropriate list of 
courses that meets all the student need based on their responses to the questions.
